        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">Virtualization and Containerization are both two different way to implement virtual
          machines with an IT network. Whichever decision you pick it will help the IT department in scaling their networking, using
          less resources, and efficient way of deploying dozens of machines in record breaking time. Both of these tools are software
          technologies that create self-contained virtual packages, beyond that they have completely different functions. To distinguish
          the two, we will different the difference and both the benefits and negative of what each can do. Virtualization creates virtual machine using a software known as hypervisor. A hypervisor is the software or firmware layer 
          that enables multiple operating systems to run side-by-side, all with access to the same physical server resources. The hypervisor
          orchestrates and separates the available resources such as power, memory, and storage, aligning a portion to each virtual machine
          as needed. It then emulates the hardware of a physical computer with a complete operating system making it possible to run what appear
          to be multiple computers with multiple different operating systems on the hardware of a single physical server. </p>

 <div class="container">
    <div class="container">
        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">1. Advantages:</p>
        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- Each can be moved and copied as easily as you can move and copy other kinds of file</p>
        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- It can centralize workloads and run several different operating systems without increasing overhead</p>
        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- You can also update apps and the OS without affecting the end-user experience.</p>

          <p class="container-fluid text-justify">2. Disadvantages:</p>
          <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- Since each VM includes an OS and a virtual copy of all the hardware the OS requires, VMs require significant RAM and CPU resources</p>
          <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- Due to the increase in virtual copies and required resources, the software development life cycle is more complex with VMs</p>
          <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- Moving VMs between public clouds, private clouds and traditional data centers can be challenging</p>

        <h2 id="the-network" class="text-center text-capitalize">Benefits of Containerization</h2>

        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">Containerization was developed to solve many of the problems of virtualization. 
          The purpose of the containers is to encapsulate an application and its dependencies within its own environment. This 
          allows them to run in isolation while they are using the same system resources and the same operating system. Since 
          the resources are not wasted on running separate operating systems tasks, containerization allows for a much quicker,
          lightweight deployment of applications.
      
        
          <p class="container-fluid text-justify">1. Advantage:</p>
          <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- The container starts immediately, since the operating system is already up and running, so the application 
              will start up without any noticeable delay</p>
          <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- Since container images are much smaller than virtual machines, they are easier to transfer and save space
              on the hostâ€™s filesystem</p>
          <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- Containers are highly suitable for short-term application needs, as they can be set up quickly, are portable, 
              and can be started up much faster</p>

          <p class="container-fluid text-justify"> 2. Disadvantage:
          <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- All containers on a particular host machine must be designed to run on the same kind of OS. Containers based 
              on a different OS will require a different host
          <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- Because the OS is shared, a security vulnerability in the OS kernel is a threat to all containers on the host
              machine
          <p class="container-fluid text-justify">- Containerization is still a new solution with wide variances in implementation plans and skilled resources, 
              making adoption a challenging process for some</p>
